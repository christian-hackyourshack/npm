# Shackhacker Christian's Public Packages

This is the monorepo, that I use to maintain my public NPM packages.

Find the packages in [./packages](./packages/).
Internal configuration packages can be found at [./config](./config/).

Some packages have dedicated websites for their documentation, find their sources at [./apps](./apps/).

## Development

For development I use a VS Code [.devcontainer](./.devcontainer/)

Happy Hacking,  
Christian
