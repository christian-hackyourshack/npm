## Basics

I distinguish between normal MDX files, and the ones that I plan to include and call the latter `partials`.

I do that, because the `:include`-directive cannot simply copy the file content, but it has to work in the MDX-world and imports the included file and renders it. Hence, it is rendered as it is imported, and as such, usually it should not have a layout.

That is, why you'll find this kind of frontmatter in my included files

```mdx

layout:

## My Partial

...
```

Of course, you could do that globally, if you put all your partials in a common directory, add a file `_frontmatter.yaml` to that directory and activate the ['Default Frontmatter' feature](/docs/#default-frontmatter).

```yaml
layout:
```
