# Welcome to :class[Magic MDX]{.shine} with Astro

## Introduction :class{.hidden}

::class{.aside-left}

If you have used [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) before, you might have noticed that MDX files tend to become quite technical.

For us tech nerds, that is mostly fine, and being able to write the content of our technical documents in Markdown is already a big gain. But for non-tech content-editors, writing this style of markdown is quite a burden, and actually I realized, that it is quite a burden for my mind, too.

::Quote[I like my content to be clean, so I decided to **dust off my MDX** with **M²DX**.]{author='Christian' from='Hack Your Shack' avatar='./christian.png'}

With the arrival of [Astro v1.0](https://astro.build)🚀 and it's [MDX Integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/), there was the chance to implement a publication pipeline that provides content-editors with the ability to write almost clean markdown, with some directives, only a few sprinkles of JSX and without overloading the frontmatter: **Astro Magic MDX** aka [**astro-m2dx**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-m2dx) was born.

With the arrival of **Astro v2.0** it became obvious, that it might be a better option to waive the magic and to provide a more explicit and flexible way to configure the MDX pipeline and still provide a magic developer/author experience.

So, I will not maintain **astro-m2dx** as an integrated remark-plugin anymore, but I split it into individual plugins, that you can use in your Astro site generator, to provide a more explicit and flexible way to configure the Astro MDX pipeline.

You will still [find the old docs here](/old-docs).

## From here...

M²DX is now a collection of remark plugins and a Picture component that supports art direction:

- [`remark-class-directive`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-class-directive): Add classes to markdown elements using a `::class` directive.
- [`remark-enhance-frontmatter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-enhance-frontmatter): Enhance the frontmatter with common attributes from central YAML files.
- [`remark-mdx-imports`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-mdx-imports): Automatically import MDX components, so you can use MDX components without the clutter.
- [`remark-mdx-includes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-mdx-includes): Include MDX files into other MDX files, so you can reuse content.
- [`remark-mdx-mappings`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-mdx-mappings): Map MDX components to markdown node types, so you can generate complex content for simple elements.
- [`remark-normalize-paths`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-normalize-paths): Normalize paths in markdown files, so you can use relative paths in your markdown and colocate all your content.
- [`remark-sectionize-headings`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-sectionize-headings): Add section elements for each heading, so you can give your content a bit more structure (and style).
- [`astro-art-direction`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-art-direction): Wrap your standard markdown images in an Astro component that allows you to control art direction by classes or any method.
