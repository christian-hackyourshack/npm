# Working with images

In Markdown, you traditionally include images with the following syntax

```md
![This is my alt text](./url-to-img.jpg 'An optional title')
```

Relative paths will be resolved relative to the markdown file.

You can't do much else without escaping to embedded HTML, e.g. if you want to set the size of an image, you would go about like this

```html
<img alt="" src="./url-to-img.jpg" width="200" height="100" />
```

## Here comes Astro MDX...

😰 It just doesn't work like this: Relative images won't work anymore, you must either move your images to the `public` directory, or you must use the `<img>` as a JSX element and import your image and use the imported image as `src` attribute:

```html
import myImg from "./url-to-img.jpg";

<img alt="" src="{myImg}" width="200" height="100" />
```

This is, what **astro-m2dx** will do for you, if you use [`relativeImages`](/docs#relative-images). With nothing more than that, you can even very easily create an [image gallery](/gallery).

🌴 Nice!

## But...

...as you would have noticed: The image gallery would be _very, very, very_ slow 🐌.

Hence, most of us would like to use some form of image optimization.
