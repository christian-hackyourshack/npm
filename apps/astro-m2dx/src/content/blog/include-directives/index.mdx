# Include directives `::include`

::include[./partial.mdx]{.foobar}

## Applying style to included partials

The `::include` directive now allows to apply CSS classes to included partials

```mdx
::include[./partial.mdx]{.my-class}
```

The included partial will now be wrapped in a div with the specified class `my-class`.

Of course, it would be nicer to apply the class to the imported root element, but that is currently not possible in Astro.
