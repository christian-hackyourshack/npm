# Astro - M²DX

If you have used [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) before, you might have noticed that MDX files tend to become quite technical.

For us tech nerds, that is mostly fine, and being able to write the content of our technical documents in Markdown is already a big gain. But for non-tech content-editors, writing this style of markdown is quite a burden, and actually I realized, that it is quite a burden for my mind, too.

I like my content to be clean, so I decided to **dust off my MDX** with `astro-m2dx`.
:::

With the arrival of [Astro v1.0](https://astro.build)🚀 and it's [MDX Integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/), there was the chance to implement a publication pipeline that provides content-editors with the ability to write almost clean markdown, with some directives, only a few sprinkles of JSX and without overloading the frontmatter: **Astro Magic MDX** was born.

Astro M²DX is a [`remark` plugin](https://remark.js.org/), that you can use in your Astro site generator, to keep your MDX close to Markdown, while still using all of the rich MDX features.

## Install

This package is provided on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-m2dx) and it is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with `npm`:

import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';
import m2dx from 'astro-m2dx';
//                ^^^^^^^^^^

/** @type {import('astro-m2dx').Options} */
const m2dxOptions = {
  // activate any required feature here
};

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [mdx()],
  markdown: {
    remarkPlugins: [[m2dx, m2dxOptions]],
    //               ^^^^
    extendDefaultPlugins: true,
  },
});
```

## The Features

Astro M²DX provides a plentitude of features, but when adding astro-m2dx to your project, none of the features is active by default, you have to activate them in the Astro configuration (and by providing the respective configuration files, e.g. for per-directory frontmatter).

## Source code for this page

Besides the plugin, the sources of this web site are published as a showcase of how to apply the plugin to a file/git-based publication workflow, [find it on Github](https://github.com/christian-hackyourshack/npm/tree/main/apps/astro-m2dx).

BTW: This is the complete MDX source for this page (embedded from the injected raw content, see feature `rawmdx` for details):

> Have a look how clean the markdown is  
> ✔️ No frontmatter  
> ✔️ No imports required  
> ✔️ Only very few components  
> ✔️ Mostly pure markdown
