# Astro - M¬≤DX

If you have used [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) before, you might have noticed that MDX files tend to become quite technical.

For us tech nerds, that is mostly fine, and being able to write the content of our technical documents in Markdown is already a big gain. But for non-tech content-editors, writing this style of markdown is quite a burden, and actually I realized, that it is quite a burden for my mind, too.

> I like my content to be clean, so I decided to _dust off my MDX_.

With the arrival of [Astro v1.0](https://astro.build)üöÄ and it's [MDX Integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/), there was the chance to implement a publication pipeline that provides content-editors with the ability to write almost clean markdown, with some directives, only a few sprinkles of JSX and without overloading the frontmatter: **Astro Magic MDX** was born.

Astro M¬≤DX is a [`remark` plugin](https://remark.js.org/), that you can use in your Astro site generator, to keep your MDX close to Markdown, while still using all of the rich MDX features.

## Install

This package is provided on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-m2dx) and it is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with `npm`:

```sh
npm install astro-m2dx
```

...and in your `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';
import m2dx from 'astro-m2dx';
//                ^^^^^^^^^^

/** @type {import('astro-m2dx').Options} */
const m2dxOptions = {
  // activate any required feature here
};

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [mdx()],
  markdown: {
    remarkPlugins: [[m2dx, m2dxOptions]],
    //               ^^^^
    extendDefaultPlugins: true,
  },
});
```

## The Features

Astro M¬≤DX provides a plentitude of features, but when adding astro-m2dx to your project, none of the features is active by default, you have to activate them in the Astro configuration (and by providing the respective configuration files, e.g. for per-directory frontmatter).

<Wrap>
  <Card href="/options/default-frontmatter">

### Default Frontmatter

Reduce the size of your frontmatter, by defining default properties in extra YAML files, that will be injected into all\* MDX files.

You could use it to define a default `layout` property for all files.

  </Card>

  <Card href="/options/export-components">

### Export `components`

Map HTML elements to JSX components: Define a mapping from standard HTML elements to complex JSX components for all\* MDX files.

  </Card>

  <Card href="/options/auto-imports">

### Auto `import`

Use JSX components in your MDX without `import`: Define a set of known JSX components, that can be used in all\* MDX files without explicitly being imported.

  </Card>

  <Card href="/options/relative-images" img="./options/relative-images.png">

### Relative Images

All relative image references (textual values) with a resolvable reference are replaced with an imported image reference in the compiled MDX.

The resolution will also be applied to obviously relative image references in JSX components.

  </Card>

  <Card href="/options/style-directives">

### Style Directives

Use markdown directives to style elements, i.e. apply CSS classes to the generated HTML elements.

‚ö†Ô∏è In order to use this feature, you must insert the plugin `remark-directive` before `astro-m2dx`.

  </Card>

  <Card href="/options/inject-rawmdx">

### Inject raw MDX

Get (read-only) access to the (really) raw MDX content of your file.

  </Card>

  <Card href="/options/inject-mdast">

### Inject MDAST

Get (read-only) access to the **M**ark**D**own **A**bstract **S**yntax **T**ree, e.g. to transform to text or analyze for added meta-info in your layout.

  </Card>

  <Card href="/options/scan-title">

### Scan title

Scan the document content for the title.

  </Card>

  <Card href="/options/scan-abstract">

### Scan abstract

Scan the document content for the abstract.

  </Card>

  <Card href="/options/add-ons">

### Add-ons

Lets users define a simple function to add their own enhancements without writing a full plugin.

  </Card>
</Wrap>

(\*) 'All' always means, you can put the definition into a directory and it will be applied to all MDX files in that directory and it's subdirectories, i.e. you can override these values in lower, more specific directories.

## Upcoming Features

Currently no further features are planned.

## Source code for this page

Besides the plugin, the sources of this web site are published as a showcase of how to apply the plugin to a file/git-based publication workflow, [find it on Github](https://github.com/christian-hackyourshack/npm/tree/main/apps/astro-m2dx).

BTW: This is the complete MDX source for this page (embedded from the injected raw content, see feature `rawmdx` for details):

> ‚úîÔ∏è No frontmatter  
> ‚úîÔ∏è No imports required  
> ‚úîÔ∏è Only very few components
