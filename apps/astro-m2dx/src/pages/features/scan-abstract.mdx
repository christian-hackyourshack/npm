# Scan Abstract

Option `scanAbstract: boolean | string`

Scan the content for the abstract and inject it into the frontmatter.

The abstract will be taken from the content between the title and the next
heading. It will only be textual content.

- true, to have it injected into property `abstract`
- name, to have it injected as property `<name>`
- default: `false`

If the frontmatter already has a property with that name, it will **NOT** be overwritten.
