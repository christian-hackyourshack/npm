# Auto import

Option `autoImports: boolean | string`

Name for auto-import files.

- name, to find files with `name` up the directory tree
- false, to disable automatic component mapping
- default: `_autoimports.ts`

Despite the suffix of the default value, these files should be simple JavaScript/ESM files (i.e. ES >=6) and not use any none-ES TypeScript features.

Now create an auto-import file exporting known components:

```js
import { Code } from 'astro/components';

export const autoimports = {
  Code,
};
```

In your MDX file you can now use `<Code ... />` without importing it:

```md
# My Title

Here I am embedding some fancy code from the frontmatter:

<Code code={frontmatter.rawmdx} />
```

> You can structure your export pretty much as you like, as long as the variable initialization is an object expression without spread operator.

Files are evaluated up the directory tree, i.e. files closer to the MDX file take precedence over files further up the tree.

The variables inside a file are evaluated in order of appearance, i.e. the following export would yield the component FuzzyBear over FozzieBear for the use in `<Bear />`, although `b` is the default export:

```js
import { FuzzyBear } from '@components/FuzzyBear';
import { FozzieBear } from '@components/FozzieBear';

export const a = {
  Bear: FuzzyBear,
};

const b = {
  Bear: FozzieBear,
};

export default b;
```
