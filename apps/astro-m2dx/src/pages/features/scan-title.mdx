# Scan Title

Option `scanTitle: boolean | string`

Scan the content for the title and inject it into the frontmatter.

The title will be taken from the first heading with depth=1,
i.e. the first line `# My Title`.

- true, to have it injected into property `title`
- name, to have it injected as property `<name>`
- default: `false`

If the frontmatter already has a property with that name, it will **NOT** be overwritten.
