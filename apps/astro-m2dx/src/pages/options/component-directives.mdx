# Component directives

```js
componentDirectives: boolean | string;
```

Map generic markdown directives to JSX components.

- default: `false`, no directives are mapped to components
- `true`, to enable mapping directives to components according to files
  with name `_directives.ts`
- `<name>`, to find directive mappings in files named `<name>`

These files should be simple JavaScript/ESM files (i.e. ES >=6), e.g.

```js
import { CTA } from '@components/CTA';

export const directives = {
  callToAction: CTA,
};
```

...and then use it in your Markdown like this:

```md
::callToAction[Dear Astronauts, grab your vacuum cleaner and dust off your MDX, now!]{href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-m2dx"}
```

⚠️ Limitation: The names of the defined directives must be valid ES variable names, i.e. you can only use names, that you do not need to quote (especially: no snake-case).
