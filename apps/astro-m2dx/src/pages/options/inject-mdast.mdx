# Inject MDAST

```js
mdast: boolean | string;
```

Inject the MD AST into the frontmatter.

- default: `false`
- `true`, to have it injected into property `mdast`
- `<name>`, to have it injected as property `<name>`

> The injected tree is not read by the HTML generation, so manipulation does not make sense.
