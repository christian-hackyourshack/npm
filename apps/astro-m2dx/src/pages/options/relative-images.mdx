# Relative Images

```js
relativeImages: boolean;
```

Resolve relative image references in MDX files.

- default: `false`
- `true`, to enable relative image resolution

All relative image references (textual values) with a resolvable reference are replaced with an imported image reference in the compiled MDX.

Original MDX

```mdx
![My alt text](my-image.png 'Fancy Title')
```

will be interpreted as if you wrote

```mdx
import rel_image__0 from './my-image.png';

<img alt="My alt text" src={rel_image__0} title="Fancy Title" />
```

The resolution will also be applied to obviously relative image references in JSX components, i.e. any attribute value that starts with `./` or `../` and has typical image suffixes will be replaced by a `MdxJsxAttributeValueExpression` similar to the above.
