# Export components

Option `exportComponents: boolean | string`

In Astro you can define a mapping from HTML elements to JSX components by exporting `const components = { ... }` in any MDX file. With this plugin you can define this export per directory, by creating a mapping-file exporting a `components` constant object expression, that maps HTML tags to JSX components:

```js
import { Title } from '@components/Title';

export const components = {
  h1: Title,
};
```

The option allows you to toggle the feature and define the name of your central mapping-files.

- name, to find mapping-files with `name` (searches up the directory tree, starting at the MDX file)
- false, to disable automatic component mapping
- default: `_components.ts`

You can use it like so:

```js
remarkPlugins: [[m2dx, {exportComponents: "_components.js"}]],
```
