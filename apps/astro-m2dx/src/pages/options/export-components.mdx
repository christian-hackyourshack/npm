# Export Components

```js
exportComponents: boolean | string;
```

Merge ESM component mapping-files into the exported `components` object of MDX files.

- default: `false`, no component mapping is merged
- `true`, to enable component mapping merging from files with name `_components.ts`
- `<name>`, to find component mapping-files with `<name>`

In Astro you can define a mapping from HTML elements to JSX components in any MDX file by exporting a constant object `components`. With this feature you can define this export per directory, by creating an ESM file exporting a `components` constant object expression, that maps HTML tags to JSX components:

```js
import { Title } from '@components/Title';

export const components = {
  h1: Title,
};
```

All files up the directory tree are merged, with mappings from the MDX file itself taking highest precedence and mappings from files furthest up the tree taking least precedence.
