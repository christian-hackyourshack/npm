# Scan Title

```js
scanTitle: boolean | string;
```

Scan the content for the title and inject it into the frontmatter.

- default: `false`
- `true`, to have it injected into property `title`
- `<name>`, to have it injected as property `<name>`

The title will be taken from the first heading with depth=1,
i.e. the first line `# My Title`.

If the frontmatter already has a property with that name, it will **NOT** be overwritten.
