# Include directive

```js
includeDirective: boolean | string;
```

Include other MDX files in your MDX file with a
`::include[./partial.mdx]` directive

- default: `false`
- `true`, to enable this directive with the name `::include`
- `<name>`, to enable the directive with name `::<name>[./ref.mdx]`

This feature renders the included MDX file without modification as loaded from its origin, i.e. if its (merged) frontmatter contains a `layout`, then it will be rendered including the layout.

> ⚠️ In order to use this feature, you must insert the plugin `remark-directive` before `astro-m2dx`.
